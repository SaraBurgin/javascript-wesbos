      // Promise is the idea of I owe you for something that will happen in the future
      // Promises are made immediately but they are not RESOLVED until they are ready (until the data comes back, until the timer is finished...)

      // 1. This is a regular function that creates a promise (new Promise) and immediately returns it. ** It is important that it is returned.
      // 2. A new promise takes a callback function as an argument and this callback function takes in two arguments itself. It will either resolve or reject whenever it feels like it is ready (in our case we feel like the pizza is ready after 0.5sec + 0.2sec for each topping)
      // 3. The logic of to how the problem is resolved is always inside the promise body.

      // toppings = [] is defaulting toppings to an empty array
      function makePizza(toppings = []) {
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          // If something went wrong, we can reject thE promise. in this case we reject if people try with pineapple

            resolve(

            );

      const peperonniPromise = makePizza(['pepperoni']);

      // 5. And then in order to get the pizza itself and the way that you access the resolved value is by chainning a .then on to it.

      // NOT every single promise needs a catch on the end, you can place one at the end of the sequence of promises but wherever the error happens it will stop running. In the case that the next step is dependant on the previous and so on this is correct but if the steps are independant from one another like our different pizzas (just because we can't do the pineapple doesn't mean we shouldn't do the rest) we should use Promise.all or Promise.race static methods.

      function handleError(err) {

      // Difference between Promise.all and Promise.allSettled is that with promise.all it assumes that all of them will go succesfully and you have to catch them with .catch(handleError) which will anyway stop when the problem is caught and Promise.settled will tell us when all of them are done regardless of if they where rejected or resolved.

      // MEGAPROMISE
